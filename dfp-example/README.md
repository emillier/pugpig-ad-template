DFP EXAMPLE ADVERT

This repository includes source code for HTML ad templates created by [Kaldor Group](http://kaldorgroup.com).

### Template

Open the template and insert your DFP network code in place of the XXX undeo the TODO comment.
Also update the rest of this URL with the details of the ad you want to serve (replace the {...} )

If you want to do an offline option you can optionally show the version below the online one, depending on the state of the user. This is a static image that is not changed or supplied by DFP. 

In this template the advert will only be shown once the Pugpig snapshot is taken. This reduces the chance of a flicker in the page.
